# Installing Python on Windows

This guide will walk you through two methods of installing Python on Windows:

1. Installing from the official Python website.
2. Installing via Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## 1. Installing from the official Python website

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Visit the Python Downloads Page**
   - Go to [Python's official download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Download the Installer**
   - Click on the "Download Python x.x.x" button (where x.x.x is the latest version).
   - This will download the executable installer for Windows.

3. **Run the Installer**
   - Navigate to your downloads folder and double-click on the downloaded file.
   - Ensure the checkbox for "Add Python x.x to PATH" is checked. This will make it easier to run Python from the command line.
   - Click on "Install Now".

4. **Verify Installation**
   - Open a new Command Prompt.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the version of Python you installed.

## 2. Installing via Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

### Prerequisites:

- Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed. If not, download it from [VSCode's official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. **Open VSCode**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Install the Python Extension**
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Python" and install the one published by Microsoft.

3. **Open the Command Palette**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.

4. **Install Python using the Command Palette**
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and select it from the dropdown.
   - If no Python interpreter is found, you'll be prompted to install one. Click on "Install" when prompted.

5. **Verify Installation**
   - Open a new terminal in VSCode by clicking on `Terminal > New Terminal`.
   - In the terminal, type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the version of Python you installed.

That's it! You now have Python installed on your Windows machine either through the official website or via VSCode.
